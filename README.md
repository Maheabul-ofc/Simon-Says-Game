## Introduction
Simon Says is a classic memory game where the player must repeat a sequence of colors that the game generates. The sequence gets longer with each level, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Features
- **Interactive Buttons**: Four colored buttons that light up when clicked or activated by the game.
- **Level Progression**: The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses through levels.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the player's current score and their best score.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive and work on various screen sizes.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. **Follow the Sequence**: Watch the sequence of colors that the game flashes and remember the order.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown by the game.
4. **Advance Levels**: If you repeat the sequence correctly, you will advance to the next level with a longer sequence.
5. **Game Over**: If you make a mistake, the game will end, and your score will be displayed. Press any key to restart the game.
