2. **Follow the Sequence**: Watch the sequence of colors that the game flashes and remember the order.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown by the game.
4. **Advance Levels**: If you repeat the sequence correctly, you will advance to the next level with a longer sequence.
